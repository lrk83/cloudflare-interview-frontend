# Cloudflare Interview Frontend

This provides the frontend for my Cloudflare General Assigment. It is a simple social media cite that can be demoed [here](https://13354f5e.cloudflare-interview-frontend.pages.dev/). 

On the cite, users can create blog posts that include text, image, and gif content, and can interact with other users' posts. From the homepage, naviate to Posts to view all the blog posts on the cite. Click on the title of a post to read more, comment, or upvote. Click on New Post in the header to make your own entry.

This project is written using React.
